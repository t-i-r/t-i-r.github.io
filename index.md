## Welcome to TIR GitHub Pages

This is [Tomas Rejtar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomas-rejtar-89994520/) and I switched from ...bucket because everybody else is already here.
I am intested in data science (multi-omics), data engineering, robotics, home automation, astronomy, electronics, etc.

I work at [Novartis](https://www.novartis.com/our-science/novartis-institutes-biomedical-research) where I am embedded in Discovery Sceinces, specifically in proteomics team applying data science to discover new medicines.

Besides work, I also enjoy outdoor activities especially mountain biking [NEMBA](https://www.nemba.org/chapters/gbnemba), running, rock climbing [Central Rock](https://centralrockgym.com/stoneham/) but also philosophy e.g. [Ludwig Wittgenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein), or architecture [van der Rohe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Mies_van_der_Rohe)
